# california-data
This serves as a space to discuss data related to stock assessments for California.  

The repository developed in 2022 in preparation for the 2023 stock assessment cycel, out of conversations between National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) stock assessment scientists and California Department of Fish and Widlife (CDFW) staff to improve the understanding of CDFW data for stock assessments.

This Document outlines the resources you may find helpful during the stock assessment cycle


**Creating a GitHub Account and Additional Resources**
Unless you plan to be running models, helping write the document, you will only need a GitHub account
To create an account visit Github.com in any browser
We will utilize GitHub Discussions for data questions, thoughts, suggestions, show and tell, etc.
If there is topic in the discussions that we come to a consensus on, we can move it to an Issue that will result in changes to the code or datastreams
Discussions allow us to keep the process more transparents and maintain a record for the next cycle or person who works with the data
No raw data will typically be stored on GitHub, just the tools to analyze data (unless we include an example in a package)


**Stock Assessment Documents**
Stock Assessment documents are written in R Markdown and live on GitHub
If you plan on helping with document writing, you could either write sections and share them as a text file, use the VS Code editor on the web, or familiarize yourself with GitHub and coordinate among STAT members

**Stock Assessment Modeling**
The new unofficial stock assessment handbook is live. The github repo has directions for editing it moving forward.
Stock Synthesis is the modeling software
The User guide is key to your success!
